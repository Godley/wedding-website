- **Day guests arrive at 2.30pm**. Refreshment drinks (juice, water) will be available.
- **Ceremony at 3pm** in the main saloon.
**We would like to request people switch their phones off and do not film or take photographs during the ceremony unless explicitly asked by the bride or groom. We have a professional photographer for the whole day and would like you all to relax and enjoy the day.**
- **Group photos from 3.30pm to 4pm**. This will be mostly family with some friends, please pay attention. We hope to get at least one group photo with all guests. Hors D'Ouvres and prosecco will be served outside between the ceremony and dinner, along with lawn games provided by the venue.
- **Wedding breakfast aka dinner served at 5pm** in the Garden Suite round the corner from the house.
- **Evening guests are requested to arrive for 7.30pm**. First dance will be at 8 in the morning room. It's recommended evening guests find food before they arrive, as we will be providing some bacon baps but they will not be served until 10pm.
- **Carriages at midnight!**
