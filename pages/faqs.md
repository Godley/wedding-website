## What should I wear?
Standard wedding gear please. Unfortunately the venue insists any stiletto shoes inside the house have to have heel protectors on the back of them to protect the floors. We will be providing some, please put them over your heels when you arrive should that be your choice of footwear.

## Should we bring gifts?
We've bought a house a couple of years ago, and are lucky enough to be well stocked with homewares as a result. We would much prefer you put the money into an amazing fascinator or top hat instead. There will be a guestbook and a postbox for cards at the venue.

## Are kids allowed?
Children of family are quite welcome. The drawing room in the main house will be available as a quiet room should anyone be feeling a bit overwhelmed or want a quiet chat with a relative :) We would appreciate if the late evening when everyone's had a few was child free, though.

## What about pets?
No dogs, cats or any other kind of animal at the venue, please, except obviously service dogs.

## How will the fascinator and hat competition be judged?
The categories of scoring will be:
- overall presentation
- whether you made it yourself
- colourfulness
But please, for the love of god, don't make it steampunk. Applications for being judgemental to be submitted on the back of a postcard.
