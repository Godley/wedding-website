## How do I RSVP?
Please email charlotte.godley@hotmail.co.uk or d.t.brown@outlook.com. If you have any song requests please feel free to send them our way!

## Can I take photos?
Please avoid using your phone and if possible, switch it off for the ceremony. We have a professional photographer for the day and would prefer to avoid screens and elbows being in any of the pictures! You are most encouraged to take as many pictures as you like after the ceremony, though we would prefer it if you didn't share them to social media until after the day (everyone who cares about our wedding is invited anyway!). If you get any good ones send them our way. We will provide a means of uploading the good 'ens to a shared area on the day.

## What should I wear?
Standard wedding wear please, please avoid royal purple or forest green solid colours (and obviously white for women!). Unfortunately the venue insists any stiletto shoes inside the house have to have heel protectors to protect the floors. We will be providing some, please put them over your heels when you arrive should that be your choice of footwear. Flats highly recommended for dancing in the evening!

## Should we bring gifts?
We bought our first house a couple of years ago, and are lucky enough to be well stocked with homewares as a result. We would much prefer you put the money into an amazing fascinator or top hat instead. There will be a guestbook and a postbox for cards at the venue.

## Are kids allowed?
Children of family are quite welcome. The drawing room in the main house will be available as a quiet room should anyone be feeling a bit overwhelmed or want a quiet chat with a relative :) We would appreciate if the late evening when everyone's had a few was child free, though.

## What about pets?
No dogs, cats or any other kind of animal at the venue, please, except obviously service dogs. 

## How will the fascinator and hat competition be judged?
The categories of scoring will be:
- overall presentation
- whether you made it yourself
- colourfulness
But please, for the love of god, don't make it steampunk. Applications for being judgemental to be submitted on the back of a postcard, or with your RSVP. 

## Will Konnie Huq be there?
Unfortunately Konnie can't make it, but she'll be sending a stand in Z list celebrity instead. She wishes everyone well and sends her apologies.
