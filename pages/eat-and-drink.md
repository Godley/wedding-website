# Proper pubs
- [The Cock Inn, Broom](https://www.thecockinnbroom.com): brown signs from the road as it's a historic pub with "no bar" - just a keg room with a table in front of it. Great rotating selection of beers. Roast of the day available every day!
- [The Anchor, Great Barford](https://www.anchorinngreatbarford.co.uk): riverside pub next to the bridge of many arches. Common for people to get takeaway food and beers and sit by the river.
- Couple of nice pubs in Gamlingay we've been meaning to check out, report back if you make it up that way!

# Cheap and cheerful
- Crown hotel, Biggleswade: Wetherspoons.
- Beego's cafe, Biggleswade: really good sandwich shop
- The Ghandi (in Sandy) - great Indian. Friendly owners and staff.
- Onsite Shuttleworth collection cafe - should be accessible to all guests any day.

# More "brunch"-y
- The Coach House, Potton: nice brunch and lunch style food, somewhat american in style.
- Rosso Lounge, Biggleswade: does great brunch, good homemade drinks and a very broad menu covering lunch and dinner. Part of a chain
- Woodview Farmshop, Gamlingay: nice cafe and butchery with a good selection of produce.

# More "bougey"
- The John O'Gaunt Pub, Sutton: another off the beaten track pub. Really good food, listed in the Mitchellin guide. Good range of food and great quality (slightly pricier though). Booking recommended.
- Stratton House Hotel does nice cocktails, very nice staff. London Pride on tap. Think it's been renamed to Saddle and Spoke, but is still inside the hotel.
- The Hare and Hound, Old Warden: the only pub in the village on the shuttleworth estate. Good selection of local brews, mostly from Bedford.
- The Black Horse at Ireland: really good, more expensive food. Really nice professional waiters. 
- Drink Biggleswade: if you're after a broad selection of more modern, more expensive and stronger microbreweries this is the place to go. Small and sociable bar down by the train station. Sells tinnies as well as 5 rotating beers on tap.
