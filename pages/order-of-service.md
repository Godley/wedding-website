- The ceremony is at 3pm. Please arrive by at least 2pm. There will be some refreshment drinks laid on. 
**We would like to request people switch their phones off and do not film or take photographs during the ceremony unless explicitly asked by the bride or groom. We have a professional photographer for the whole day and would like you all to relax and enjoy the day.**
- Group photos outside the house will follow from 3.30pm until 4. This will be mostly family with some friends, please pay attention. :)
